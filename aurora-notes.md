# Minimal Zones
- Minimal zone images https://github.com/ptribble/mvi/blob/master/zmvix.sh
- Package manager integration?
- Use manifests and the file lists inside of there.
# Kubernetes
- Awesome kubernetes https://github.com/ramitsurana/awesome-kubernetes
- Compile docs https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/kubernetes/compiling-kubernetes-binaries
- Docker Term needs to be pointed to moby/term until it lands in kubernetes to version in kubernetes
  - ~/workspace/go/nomad/vendor/github.com/docker/docker

  - bootstrap new cluster with this node as regeant
    - in existing cloud
    - without cloud (cloud must then be boostrapped with cloudadm)
  - update the nodes packages
- cloudadm
  - bootstrap a new cloud
    - cloud login (OpenDJ oder Ã¤hnliches)
    - management network layer
    - integrate cluster into central login
    - add provider tenant and admin account
